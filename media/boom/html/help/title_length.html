<h1>Page title length</h1>

<p><strong>The length of page titles is restricted to 70 characters</strong></p>
<p>Ideally page titles should be shorter than the 70 characters allowed - the current <a href="http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/TITLE.html" target="_blank">recommendation from W3C is 64 characters</a>.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons for this restriction. The first is related to SEO as Google will mark down pages which have page titles which it considers to be excessively long.</p>
<p>Another reason, related to SEO, is that search engines will truncate long page titles to fit them into the search engine results pages. There’s a good summary of what the different search engines recommend at <a href="http://blog.powermapper.com/blog/post/Page-Title-Length-for-Search-Engines.aspx" target="_blank">http://blog.powermapper.com/blog/post/Page-Title-Length-for-Search-Engines.aspx</a></p>. If search engines don’t display the page title in full then it’s going to be more difficult to get people to click through to the page.
<p>Also, for accessibility reasons it’s best to have short page titles. On pages where much of the content is made up of the titles of other pages (e.g. a search results page or blog landing page) it would take someone using a screen reader longer to get an idea of what your pages are about if the page titles are long.
