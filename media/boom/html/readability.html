<h1>Readability Measure</h1>
<p>
	The page readability measure gives the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMOG">SMOG grade</a> for the page. This gives an indication of the number of years education needed to read the page.
</p>
<p>
	Some caveats to consider:
	<ul>
		<li>The readability score is generated from the standfirst and bodycopy text. If this text isn't present for a particular template, or is very short, then the readability score will not be useful.</li>
		<li>A readability score will only be accurate for text which is in English.</li>
	</ul>
